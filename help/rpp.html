                <p>
                    The Roleplay Point system is designed as a way to recognise players who make an active contribution to the in-character world, as well as rewarding those who take 
                    on roles that enrich the experience of the broader community.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Roleplay points are awarded by the decision of administrators at their discretion, but in line with these guidelines. Roleplay points may also be taken away for 
                    behaviour not consistent with expectations.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Other than the recognition of your good play, the key benefits of roleplay points are twofold:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Certain character creation picks require a minimum amount of RPP to be unlocked. This is usually because an option requires someone who has demonstrated a certain 
                    level of capability or maturity, but may also be used somewhat to gate-keep certain highly desirable options as rewards for that same good play.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Roleplay points impose a cap on the total number of Chargen Points an account can accumulate; so accounts with more roleplay points will have the potential to accrue more of these and therefore unlock more options with a single character (or pick these options more frequently).
                    As a guideline, we would expect a minimum of one month between each level of award, but may award more frequently than that for what we believe to be exceptional play.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Upon earning an RPP you must wait a specified time period before you can earn another. The time periods are as follows:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                      <li>
                          RPP 1 and RPP 2 - 30 days
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          RPP 3 and RPP 4 - 60 days
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          RPP 5 and Beyond - 90 days                        
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    Broadly speaking, these descriptions below describe the kind of behaviour that would warrant a player receiving each of the roleplay point awards:

                                    Players without any roleplay points are unproven, or have proven themselves to be unreliable. The player might still have trouble distinguishing between IC and OOC, may overuse 
                                    OOC communication in-game, or may largely ignore the RP element of the game in favour of treating the game as something to be “won”.

                                    Players with 1 roleplay point have shown that they understand the key standards of behaviour expected of them and can consistently remain in-character. They make a genuine effort to engage 
                                    with the game and with other players. This first award is all but guaranteed for players who follow the few rules we have and consistently roleplay; it is expected that all players who can

                                    Players with 2 roleplay points have repeatedly and consistently shown that they are a good roleplayer and Arda is a little richer for their presence. They clearly and 
                                    implicitly understand the expectations of behaviour and can be relied on to make good judgement calls. When a gameplay mechanic is at odds with a sensible story outcome, they 
                                    choose to err on the side of the story outcome. If they do choose to participate in the OOC community, they interact positively with it and are generally well regarded.

                                    Players with 5 roleplay points, in addition to the requirements of the previous levels, have demonstrated that they have range. This kind of player can be relied upon to play more 
                                    than one archetype. Leaders, followers, lone-wolves, social characters, combat monsters; they can fit comfortably into at least most of these roles. At this level, they should 
                                    also have a good understanding of most of the game mechanics across a wide variety of roles and be able to work these into their roleplay, and also be able to instruct others.

                    <p>
                        Build points are a resource that can be earned naturally as you progress and play through the game. You will passively earn build points as you interact with the world
                        with a cap of 1,000 build points. Build points are a new concept and we are working out the details on how they can be utilized the best. Currently, Build Points
                        can be used during character generation to begin the game with extra accents or written languages. In the future, we will be adding other ways for build points to be spent such 
                        knowledges, skill boosts, and stat changes.
