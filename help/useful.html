                        <span class="commandDesc">
                            Allows you to describe an action that you are undertaking, and is one of the core roleplaying commands which you will have to master. The emote command 
                            (as well as any other attached emote in other commands throughout the game) uses the special markup text described in this helpfile.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The syntax for using the emote command is emote <em>message</em>. Note that if you do not use the @ token at some point in your emote, it will be prepended to 
                            the beginning of your emote automatically. For example, emote ducks down is equivalent to emote @ ducks down.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You can use the following tokens in your emotes:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            ~keyword - targets a person and displays their short description or "you" to
                            them
                            <br />
                            ~keyword's - targets a person and displays their short description + 's or
                            "your" to them
                            <br />
                            ~#keyword - targets a person and displays "he/she/it/they" or "you"
                            <br />
                            ~!keyword - targets a person and displays "him/her/it/they" or "you"
                            <br />
                            ~!keyword's - targets a person and displays "his/her/its/their" or "your"
                            <br />
                            The token @ is equivalent to using ~ and targetting yourself, however it cannot
                            be modified with ! or #.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You can replace the ~ in the above emotes with a * in order to target items
                            instead of people.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You can also include brief fragments of speech in your emotes (including
                            bracketed emotes following other commands) if you would like. Simply include
                            the speech in double quotes, e.g. emote smacks his hand with *hammer and says
                            "Ouch!". Note that any speech you include in an emote will be in whichever
                            language and accent you are presently using (see help speak), and that not
                            everyone may understand what you say.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Note that you can use multiple keywords in the target by linking them with
                            periods (.), e.g. ~tall.blue-eyed.man
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Also note that you can target the nth matching target by doing n.keywords, e.g.
                            *2.silver.sword
                            </span>
